This little project is just me playing around with the concepts of Recurrent Neural Networks and Long-Short Term Memory networks.

You can find the code mainly in the LSTM and RNN modules, with the Types module defining the types and the Utils module some utility functions.
There is also a genetic algorithm module built on top of simple-genetic-algorithm-mr, and some text encoding/decoding functions in Data.

The main module shows the library being exercised to generate "Hello World!", you can have a look for inspiration. Any feed back welcome!
